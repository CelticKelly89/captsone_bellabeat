Share

Those who spent the most time in bed got the most sleep.
Those who took the most steps burned the most calories.
Higher activity levels are positively correlated with more hours of sleep.
More hours of sleep are positively correlated with better weight management.
Lightly active particpants had the highest number of data point entries for each category (sleep, steps, etc.)
Lightly active particpants achieved the most stable sleep trends of consistenly getting 8 hours of sleep.

Act

Incentivize sleep through gamification- the more consistent sleep logs particpants have the more points they win. Use the bellabeat community to encourage accountability partners and external competition for discounts on products, access to new items first, or private health coach sessions.
Send positively worded push notifications regarding light activity, emphasizing that a little bit of movement is better than none and may reduce your stress the most, while aiding sleep. 
Consider sending daily facts about sleep hygeine and moderate activity to empower customers with their own hard data.
Offer quarterly summmary dashboards of categories (sleep trends, activity trends, calories trends, etc.) so the data-driven customer can see their progress and areas to work on, not just in a yearly wrap up, but a 3 month basis allowing for behavior change implementation.
